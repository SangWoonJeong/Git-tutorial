## Models (사용한 모델이 여러개일 경우 작성)

The models used in our research are:
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **Transformer**


## Repository Structure

- **data/**: exmaple dataset
- **src/**: model 구현에 필요한 source, package 등
- **results/**: Stores the results and performance metrics of the models.
- **checkpoints/**: saved models.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SangWoonJeong/Git-tutorial.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Git-tutorial
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the training script:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

## Results

The results section will include the performance metrics for each model under the specified delay times. This may include accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
